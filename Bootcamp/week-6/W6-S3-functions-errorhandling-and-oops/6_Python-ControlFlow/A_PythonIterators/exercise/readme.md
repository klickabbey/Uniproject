# 🐍 Python Iterators

## 🎯 Challenge

Your challenge is to understand how Python iterators work and demonstrate their usage.

## 📚 Key Learnings

By completing this exercise, you will learn:

- How to use built-in Python iterators with collections like lists and strings.
- How to manually retrieve values from iterators using `iter()` and `next()`.
- The importance of handling the `StopIteration` exception.

## 👤 User Story

As a Python developer, I want to efficiently traverse through sequences of data without loading the entire collection into memory at once.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- The Python script is named `iterators.py`.
- The script demonstrates:
  - Using `iter()` and `next()` on built-in Python collections.
  - Proper handling of the `StopIteration` exception.
  
## 🛠️ Steps to Complete

1. **📁 Create a new Python file**: Name the file `iterators.py`.

2. **🔗 Use built-in iterators**: Create iterators from built-in collections like lists, strings, and tuples using `iter()` and manually retrieve elements using `next()`.

3. **🔄 Loop through an iterator**: Demonstrate how Python handles iteration in a `for` loop using an iterator.

4. **⚙️ Handle StopIteration**: Show how to handle the `StopIteration` exception that occurs when an iterator is exhausted.

5. **📤 Print results**: Print the results of each operation to verify that iterators work as expected.

6. **💬 Comment your code**: Ensure that each section of the script is properly commented for clarity.

## Tips

- Iterators provide a way to efficiently loop through data without loading the entire sequence into memory.

## Submission

Once you complete the task, submit the `iterators.py` file to your instructor.
