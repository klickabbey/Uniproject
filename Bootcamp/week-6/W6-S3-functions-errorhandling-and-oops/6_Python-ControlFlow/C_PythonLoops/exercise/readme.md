# 🐍 Python Loops

## 🎯 Challenge

Your challenge is to create a Python script that demonstrates the use of loops for iterating over sequences. Focus on understanding `for` loops and `while` loops, and how to control the flow with `break` and `continue` statements.

## 📚 Key Learnings

By completing this exercise, you will learn:

- How to use `for` loops to iterate over lists, tuples, and ranges.
- How to use `while` loops for repeated execution based on a condition.
- How to control loop execution with `break` and `continue` statements.

## 👤 User Story

As a Python developer, I want to understand how to use loops to iterate over data structures and control the flow of my program effectively.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- The Python script is named `loops.py`.
- The script demonstrates:
  - Iterating over a list, tuple, and range using `for` loops.
  - Using `while` loops for repeated tasks.
  - Controlling loop execution with `break` and `continue`.

## 🛠️ Steps to Complete

1. **📁 Create a new Python file**: Name the file `loops.py`.

2. **🔄 Demonstrate `for` loops**: Iterate over a list, a tuple, and a range using `for` loops.

3. **🔄 Demonstrate `while` loops**: Create a `while` loop that runs until a condition is met.

4. **🔀 Control flow in loops**: Use `break` to exit a loop early and `continue` to skip to the next iteration.

5. **📤 Print results**: Print the results of each loop operation for clarity.

6. **💬 Comment your code**: Ensure that each section of the script is properly commented for clarity.

## Tips

- Use `for` loops when iterating over sequences or ranges.
- Use `while` loops for tasks that need to be repeated until a specific condition changes.

## Submission

Once you complete the task, submit the `loops.py` file to your instructor.

Happy coding information freaks!
