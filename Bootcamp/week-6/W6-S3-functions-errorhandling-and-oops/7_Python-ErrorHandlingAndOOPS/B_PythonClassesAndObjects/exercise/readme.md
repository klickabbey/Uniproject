# 🐍 Python Classes and Objects

## 🎯 Challenge

Your challenge is to create a Python script that demonstrates the use of classes and objects. Focus on defining classes, creating objects, and understanding how to use methods and attributes.

## 📚 Key Learnings

By completing this exercise, you will learn:

- How to define and instantiate classes.
- How to use methods and attributes within classes.
- How to understand the concepts of encapsulation and object-oriented programming.

## 👤 User Story

As a Python developer, I want to understand how to create and use classes and objects to model real-world entities and behaviors in my code.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- The Python script is named `classes_objects.py`.
- The script demonstrates:
  - Defining a class with attributes and methods.
  - Creating instances (objects) of the class.
  - Accessing and modifying attributes.
  - Calling methods on objects.

## 🛠️ Steps to Complete

1. **📁 Create a new Python file**: Name the file `classes_objects.py`.

2. **📜 Define a class**: Create a class with an `__init__` method to initialize attributes.

3. **🔧 Add methods**: Define methods within the class to perform actions or calculations.

4. **🛠️ Create objects**: Instantiate objects from the class and demonstrate accessing their attributes and methods.

5. **📤 Print results**: Print the results of operations to verify that the class and its methods work as expected.

6. **💬 Comment your code**: Ensure that each section of the script is properly commented for clarity.

## Tips

- Use the `__init__` method to initialize class attributes.
- Methods within a class should have `self` as their first parameter to access instance attributes.
